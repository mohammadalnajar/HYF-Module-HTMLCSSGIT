1- In order to hide a file or a folder all you need is using the coming command:
	attrib +h <fileName> with this method the file might still visible if you have choosen to show your hidden files, otherwise you use (attrib +s +h <fileName>) instead.
	attrib -s -h to make the file visible again.

2- In order to create multiple nested directories you need to use the coming command:

3- In order to append a message to a file ,without a newline character we can use multiple methods:
	a- echo -e and between each word you can write (\n) like [echo -e 'this is the first line \n this is the second line' >> <fileName.txt>]
	b- as we learnt in the freecodecamp video , he taught us a good command to add whatever text we want and wherever we want :
		using 'vim <textFileName>', press {i} which refers to -insert-, then we have the ability to navigate where we want to add a text, and after typing the text we should press ESC then {:wq!} to save the changes we made;
